# Phase 1 Action Items - Foundation Consolidation

**Target Completion**: Month 2  
**Phase Objective**: Stabilize and solidify the existing P9ML foundation

## Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2) 🏃‍♂️

### High Priority Tasks

**🧪 Performance Baseline Establishment** `DUE: Week 2`
- [ ] Set up benchmark testing infrastructure
- [ ] Create performance test suite for nn vs P9ML networks
- [ ] Document baseline metrics (training time, memory usage, inference speed)
- [ ] **Owner**: Performance Team | **Est.**: 40 hours

**📋 API Standardization** `DUE: Week 2` 
- [ ] Review current P9ML API patterns
- [ ] Define standardized error handling approach
- [ ] Create API documentation template
- [ ] **Owner**: API Team | **Est.**: 30 hours

## Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-4) 🏃‍♂️

### High Priority Tasks

**✅ Complete Unit Test Coverage** `DUE: Week 3`
- [ ] Audit current test coverage for P9ML components
- [ ] Write missing unit tests to reach 95% coverage
- [ ] Add integration tests for membrane communication
- [ ] Set up automated coverage reporting
- [ ] **Owner**: Development Team | **Est.**: 60 hours

**📚 Tutorial Creation** `DUE: Week 4`
- [ ] Write "Migration from nn to P9ML" tutorial
- [ ] Create "Getting Started with P9ML" guide
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section for common issues
- [ ] **Owner**: Documentation Team | **Est.**: 50 hours

## Sprint 3 (Weeks 5-6) 🏃‍♂️

### Medium Priority Tasks

**🔧 Code Examples Expansion** `DUE: Week 3`
- [ ] Computer vision example (CNN with P9ML membranes)
- [ ] Natural language processing example (RNN with cognitive features)
- [ ] Reinforcement learning example (adaptive policy networks)
- [ ] **Owner**: Examples Team | **Est.**: 45 hours

## Success Criteria for Phase 1 ✅

- [ ] **95%+ test coverage** across all P9ML components
- [ ] **Performance benchmarks** established and documented

- [ ] **10+ working examples** across CV, NLP, and RL domains
- [ ] **API documentation** complete with consistent patterns

## Blockers & Dependencies 🚫

| Blocker | Impact | Owner | Resolution Plan |
|---------|--------|--------|----------------|
| Missing test infrastructure | High | DevOps | Set up CI/CD pipeline by Week 1 |
| Torch dependency issues | Medium | Platform Team | Update dependencies and test |
| Documentation tooling | Low | Docs Team | Set up MkDocs or similar |

## Weekly Check-ins 📅

- **Monday 9am**: Sprint planning and blocker review
- **Wednesday 2pm**: Mid-week progress check  
- **Friday 4pm**: Sprint retrospective and next week planning

## Next Phase Preview 👀
